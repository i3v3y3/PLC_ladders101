# Power Supply Module
This is a design for a handheld power supply module, to be used in powering simple projects for instance when testing designs in areas where you can only get the normal Mains Power supply of 240VAC. Now the design switches it to, 12V, 5V, and 3.3V supply. This is in consideration that most modules use 5V or 3.3V power supply and microcontrollers such as ESP32 require a voltage of about 3.3V. This makes it easier to just use the 240 V and drop it down to 5V and 3.3V.
