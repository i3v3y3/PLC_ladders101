# Power Supply Module
This is a design for a handheld power supply module, to be used in powering simple projects for instance when tesing designs in areas where you can only get the normal Mains Power supply of 240VAC. Now the design switches it to , 12V, 5V and 3.3V supply. This is in consideration that most modules use 5v or 3.3V power supply. As well as microcontrollers such as ESP32 that require a voltage of about 3.3V. This mmakes it easier for you to just use the 240 V and dropping it down to 5V and 3.3V.
